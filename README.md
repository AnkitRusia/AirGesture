# AirGesture
Controlling Swiping gesture using Camera with colored objects 


Over the last years deep learning methods have been shown to outperform previous state-of-the-art machine learning techniques in several 
fields, with computer vision being one of the most prominent cases. In air gesture recognition is used for interacting with the computer it 
will recognize the colored objects according to a different vision-based algorithm. The user interacts with a virtual plane that rests in 
between the user and the display. On this plane, air gestures are tracked and sequences of gestures are recognized and according to that 
gesture, it will perform the keyboard operation. In this process, a lot of image and video analysis boils down to simplifying the source as 
much as possible. This almost always begins with a conversion to grayscale, but it can also be a color filter, gradient, or a combination 
of these.

 
I performed the following operations : Background Subtraction, Color filtering, Edge detection, Window Sliding operation, Feature 
Extraction and Win32 COM Objects Control.
